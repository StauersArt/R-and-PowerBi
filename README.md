Aim: To analyze the performance of Hollywood movies 

Data: Title, genre, studio, profitability and ratings for movies released 2007-2012. Source: [Hollywood movies](https://github.com/StauersArt/R-and-PowerBi/issues/2#issue-1506159122)

---------

The task was to clean data and create dashboard with fallowing information:</br></br>
• The average ratings of each genre </br>
• The number of movies produced per year </br>
• The audience scores for each film </br>
• The profitability per studio </br>
• The worldwide gross per genre

------

For cleaning data I used RStudio application but dashboard I made in PowerBi Application.

-------

What I learned from this task is that to get better result it's important to clean data from fileds where data is missing. But as data analitics it's better remember that sometimes no data is also data.

The prisoner are lined up in order of height, and are tied to stakes. The man in the rear can see the backs of his two friends, the man in the middle can see the back of the man in front, and the man in front cannot see anyone. The Nagas show the men five hats. Three of the hats are black and two of the hats are white.

Blindfolds are then placed over each man’s eyes and a hat is placed on each man’s head. The two hats left over are hidden. The blindfolds are then removed and it is said to the men that if one of them can guess what color hat he is wearing they can all leave unharmed.

The man in the rear who can see both of his friends’ hats but not his own says, “I don’t know”. The middle man who can see the hat of the man in front, but not his own says, “I don’t know”. The front man who cannot see ANYBODY’S hat says “I know!”

How did he know the color of his hat and what color was it?
